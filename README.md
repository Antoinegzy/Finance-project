You can find on this page some of my personnal projects on python related to finance and economics ! (In progress)

- Option Pricing and volatility

- Scraping project :
    1 - example of expected output (trading economics) :  you can see here an example of the visual expected output as usable economic calendar)
    2 - raw_data_from_request : here it is the raw data after the first request
    3 - cal_eco : here it is the final output after data modification and excel file manipulation
To work properly, economic_calendar_scraping should be run in the same file as the different flags.
